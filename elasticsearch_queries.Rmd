## Relevance

Let's experiment with a few search queries to experiment with the relevance:

* Search for documents that have `king` or `queen` in the `text_entry` field:

## Combining queries


Let's experiment with some combination of queries:

*	Execute a search for documents that must include the term `king` and and are ranked higher if they either contain the terms `queen`, `fight`, or `hail`.
